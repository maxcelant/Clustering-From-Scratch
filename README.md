# Clustering From Scratch
I created this model using only the mathematical equations necessary to run the clustering algorithm. 
Using the various steps of the K-means algorithm, we can create our own model without using a library like TensorFlow to do it for us.
Obviously, TF will be optimized to performance, but I made this little project to see if I could and to gain a deeper understanding of Unsupervised Models.
